# Master Development & Implementation Plan
**Role:** Project Manager / Executive Sponsor
**Project:** RMG Traceability Software
**Status:** Approved for Execution

---

## 1. Executive Summary
This document serves as the master roadmap for transitioning the RMG Traceability Software from the design/documentation phase to active coding, hardware installation, and final factory rollout. We will follow an **Agile (Scrum)** methodology, breaking the 12 modules into manageable 2-week Sprints.

---

## 2. Phase 1: Environment Setup & Architecture (Week 1)
Before coding any business logic, the foundation must be solid.
- **Backend:** Initialize Laravel 13, setup DDD (Domain-Driven Design) folder structures, configure PostgreSQL and Redis.
- **Frontend:** Initialize React (Vite), configure TailwindCSS, and setup Zustand/TanStack Query.
- **DevOps:** Setup GitHub Actions for CI/CD, create `docker-compose.yml` for local development.

---

## 3. Phase 2: Agile Sprints Breakdown (Development Phase)

### Sprint 1: Foundation (Weeks 2-3)
- **Module 11 (Auth & Admin):** Implement Spatie RBAC (Roles & Permissions), User Login (Sanctum API).
- **Module 01 (Master Data):** Buyers, Styles, Colors, Sizes, Factory Lines.

### Sprint 2: Planning & Upstream (Weeks 4-5)
- **Module 02 & 03 (Order Mgmt & Planning):** PO creation, BOM, Production Routing.
- **Module 04 (Cutting & Bundling):** The absolute core. Generating the Master Bundle QR and the Child Single-Piece QRs.

### Sprint 3: The High-Traffic Core (Weeks 6-7)
- **Module 05 (Value Addition):** Print/Embroidery dispatch and receive.
- **Module 06 (Sewing Line Tracking):** Implementing the Offline-First Tablet API and Redis Queues to handle extreme concurrency (Line In / Line Out).

### Sprint 4: Quality & Downstream (Weeks 8-9)
- **Module 07 (Quality Control):** SVG Body Map UI for defect tracking, WebSockets (Reverb) for real-time DHU alerts.
- **Module 08 & 09 (Washing & Packing):** Carton generation and mapping Single Pieces to Cartons.

### Sprint 5: Inventory & Export (Weeks 10-11)
- **Module 10 (Inventory):** Double-entry ledger logic, DB Transactions for concurrent stock updates.
- **Module 12 (Export & Analytics):** Loading containers, generating Commercial Invoices, and BI Dashboards.

---

## 4. Phase 3: Hardware & Network Setup (Week 10)
Occurs concurrently with Sprint 5.
- **Network:** Install dedicated Wi-Fi routers on the factory floor (Sewing, QC, Packing) ensuring low latency to the local server.
- **Hardware:** Procure and configure Android Tablets (Offline-first SQLite app installed) and Zebra/Honeywell Bluetooth Barcode Scanners.

---

## 5. Phase 4: UAT & Pilot Run (Weeks 12-13)
**Rule: Do NOT deploy to the entire factory at once.**
- **Pilot Selection:** Select ONE highly efficient Sewing Line (e.g., Line 04) to pilot the software.
- **Execution:** Run the physical garments through Cutting -> Line 04 (Sewing) -> QC -> Packing using the new software.
- **Feedback Loop:** Gather feedback from operators regarding scanner speed and UI visibility. Fix UI bugs.

---

## 6. Phase 5: Go-Live & Handover (Week 14)
- **Rollout:** Expand to all remaining sewing lines and departments.
- **Training:** Conduct training sessions for Commercial Managers, QA Leads, and Store Keepers.
- **Handover:** Final sign-off from the Executive Sponsor.
