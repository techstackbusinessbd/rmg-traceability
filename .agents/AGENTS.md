## Core Architecture Principles
- API-First

- Offline-First for mobile/tablet apps
- Strict Transaction Integrity
- **Validation Standard**: Pure Server-Side Validation Only. Do NOT use native HTML5 validation (`required`, `minlength`, `maxlength`, `pattern`, or browser popup tooltips). Forms must include `noValidate` and handle error feedback strictly from backend API responses (HTTP 422 JSON errors).

## UI/UX Engineering Rules
- **UI Language**: All UI labels, buttons, tables, and messages MUST be in 100% English.
- **Button Styling**: Buttons MUST use flat, crisp, solid colors. Gradient buttons are strictly prohibited.
- **Git Branching**: All development commits MUST go to `develop` branch. `main` is reserved for production releases.

## Communication Rules
- **Language**: You MUST always communicate with the user in Bengali (Bangla).
- **Implementation Plans**: All implementation plans and documentation must also be written in Bengali (Bangla).
